# What is a Data Structure?
Data structures are tools to store, organize, process, and retrieve information from the computers memory. They store information about the data and relationships between them, not only that but also providing function that can be applied to the data.
# Characteristics
Data structures can have many characteristics, such as:
## Liner or non linear
- **Linear data structures** arrange information in a sequential order, like a list where each element follows the previous one. In contrast, **non-linear data structures** store data in a more flexible way, where the order itself might not be as important
## Homogeneous or non-homogeneous
- **Homogeneous** means that every entry inside of the data structure is of the same type, while **non-homogeneous** means that the type of some elements might be different. 
## Static or Dynamic
- **Static data structures** have a **predefined size** while **Dynamic data structures** **grow or shrink in size** as needed
