# Lists
## Array
An **array** is like a box that holds a set number of items of the same kind. Each item has a specific position (index) for easy access. Imagine it as a shopping cart where each slot holds a grocery item (data type) and you can grab any item by its number (index).
Its also a linear data structure, which means that the items are stored in a chronological order. 
## Linked list
Linked lists might seem similar to arrays at first glance, but their internal data storage is fundamentally different. Linked lists are not inherently linear in memory. Instead, they consist of individual nodes, each containing data and a reference (often a memory address) to the next node in the sequence. This means a node only knows about its own data and the next element in the chain, not the entire list's structure.
