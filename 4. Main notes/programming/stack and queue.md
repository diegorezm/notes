# stack and queue
Stacks and queues are both linear data structures, which means that data can only flow one way. The only difference between them is how they manage the data that they stored.
## FIFO (first-in-first-out)
A **FIFO** queue is like a line at a store. The first person in line (the oldest element) is the first one to be served (the element that is taken out first). This is why it's called a first-in, first-out queue.
## LIFO (last-in-first-out)
A **LIFO** is the exact opposite of **FIFO**, instead of removing the first ever element inside of the data structure it removes the elements that just got in there.
